# GitHub Profile README Setup Checklist

## ✅ Requirements for Profile README to Display

1. **Repository Name**: Must be exactly `trilltino/trilltino` ✓
2. **Repository Visibility**: Must be **PUBLIC** ⚠️ (Check this!)
3. **README.md**: Must be in root directory ✓
4. **Default Branch**: Must be on `main` branch ✓
5. **Content**: README.md must have content ✓

## 🔍 How to Check if Repository is Public

1. Go to: https://github.com/trilltino/trilltino
2. Look for a "Public" or "Private" badge next to the repository name
3. If it says "Private", you need to make it public

## 🔓 How to Make Repository Public

1. Go to: https://github.com/trilltino/trilltino
2. Click on **Settings** (top right of the repository)
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section
4. Click **Change visibility**
5. Select **Make public**
6. Type `trilltino/trilltino` to confirm
7. Click **I understand, change repository visibility**

## ⏱️ After Making Public

- GitHub profile README usually appears within a few minutes
- Clear your browser cache if it doesn't show up immediately
- Visit: https://github.com/trilltino (your profile page, not the repository)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If the README still doesn't show after making it public:

1. Verify the repository is public: https://github.com/trilltino/trilltino
2. Verify README.md exists: https://github.com/trilltino/trilltino/blob/main/README.md
3. Check you're viewing your profile (not the repo): https://github.com/trilltino
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to update
5. Try incognito/private browsing window
6. Clear browser cache

## 📝 Note

The README file has been successfully pushed to the repository.
The only remaining step is ensuring the repository is PUBLIC.
